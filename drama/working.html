                    <p>
                        When the last factory in a small Rust Belt town closes its doors, an unlikely hero emerges in
                        dutiful, quiet Allery Parkes. A career employee of the factory, the aging Allery canâ€™t reconcile
                        how to live a life simply sitting at home doing nothing. Against the advice and pleas of his
                        loving wife Iola, he forms an unlikely friendship with his charismatic neighbor Walter Brewer in
                        order to revive the defunct factory.
